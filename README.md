STUDIO ONE EXPORT RENAMER
changes base/number/name.ext to base/number_name.ext


Written to make renaming exported audio files from Presonus Studio One less tedious.

Usage: 
1. Drop the base folder (i.e. "YourExport" with all the subfolders and files like "YourExport\01 Start\Track.wav", "YourExport\02\Track.wav" and "YourExport\03\Track.wav") onto the executable. 
2. A console will open.
3. The program will rename and move your files to "YourExport\01-Track.wav", "YourExport\02-Track.wav" etc.
4. Any error will halt the program and pop up a message box.
